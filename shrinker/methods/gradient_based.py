"""Removes the filters/neurons whose removal would change the loss the least (Taylor importance).
 

The importance of a filter is estimated with a first-order Taylor expansion of the loss: removing
a parameter w with loss gradient g changes the loss by about g * w. A filter's score combines
this term over all of its parameters (its weights and bias, plus the scale and shift of the
BatchNorm that follows it). Scores are averaged over a few mini-batches, and in every prunable
layer the filters with the lowest scores are removed.
 
Unlike weight-only criteria (l1_pruning, fpgm) this method needs data and a loss, so it takes a
``loader`` that yields ``(inputs, labels)``.
 
Two ways of combining a filter's per-parameter terms are available through ``reduce``:
    "sum_of_squares" (default)  score = sum over the filter's parameters of (g * w) ** 2
    "square_of_sum"             score = (sum over the filter's parameters of g * w) ** 2
 
Gradients come from mini-batches (a cheaper stand-in for per-sample gradients), with the model
in eval mode so BatchNorm statistics and dropout are not disturbed.
