"""Removes the filters closest to the layer's geometric median, i.e. the most redundant ones.

Paper: He et al. 2019, Filter Pruning via Geometric Median, https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00250

A filter near the geometric median of its layer can be represented by the other filters, so
removing it loses little. Following Eq. 4-9 of the paper, the median itself is never computed:
the filters with the smallest total distance to the other filters are the ones to remove.
